# Bluetooth_Controlled_Robot

Welcome to the Bluetooth Controlled Robot repository! This project showcases a versatile robot that can be remotely controlled using Bluetooth technology. This repository includes all necessary code, schematics, and documentation to help you build and customize your own Bluetooth controlled robot. 

Features: 
  1. Bluetooth Connectivity: Control the robot using a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone 
  2. Easy to Assemble: Simple hardware setup with detailed instructions and schematics.
  3. Customizable Code: Arduino-based firmware that is easy to modify and extend.
  4. Versatile Movement: Supports various movement commands, including forward, backward, left, right, and stop.
  5. Interactive Control: Real-time control via a dedicated mobile app.

Hardware Requirements: 
  1. Microcontroller: Arduino Uno/Nano.
  2. Bluetooth Module: HC-05 Bluetooth module.
  3. Motor Driver: L293D or similar motor driver module.
  4. Geared DC Motors - 2
  5. Chassis: Robot chassis  with wheels - 2.
  6. Power Supply: Battery pack suitable for the motors and microcontroller.
  7. Miscellaneous: Jumper wires, breadboard, and other basic electronic components.

Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE: For programming the Arduino microcontroller.
Bluetooth Terminal App: For controlling the robot from a mobile device. For example: "Arduino Bluetooth Control" for android and "LightBlue" for ios.
